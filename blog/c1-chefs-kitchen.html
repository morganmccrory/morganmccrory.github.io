I think that DBC is completely unique and innovative. I have heard many people criticize the current method of learning that we utilize here in the U.S., but I have not seen anyone really take action and suggest a new method. Until Dev Bootcamp. They seem to take a new-age approach to teaching and learning, and it is very inspiring. I knew that I had joined something great when the first challenge of Week 1 was to explore study habits and meditation methods that would be useful. This type of thing is not taught in traditional schools, yet is extremely valuable as a person and as a student. This attitude, including other activities such as the mandatory yoga, is awesome. <br><br>
I see myself engaging with this type of culture extremely well. As Shereef explained in the video, the students who get the most out of it will be the students who approach it as a kitchen table. It is an experiment, and we're all in this together. I think that I will get out of it what I put into it - and that holds true for most things in life as well. I see myself walking in on the first day with a chef's apron on and ready to dive in!<br><br>
My expectations haven't really changed, but I think the video made me more aware of what is expected of me. It also showed me what the mindset of the instructors will be. I will admit, I do suffer from the imposter syndrome, and I can foresee that happening when the in-person unit begins. However, knowing that we're all in the same boat and everyone else is probably feeling the same way, gives me more confidence. I would say that I am more excited than nervous. I am ready! I was born ready! :)
