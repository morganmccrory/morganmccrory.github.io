      <h1>Fireside Chat (or We're Cooking in a Chef's Kitchen)</h1>

      <p>So, we were asked to watch <a href="http://vimeo.com/85001014">this video</a>, which is a <b>Fireside Chat</b> with Dev Bootcamp founder, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/shereefb">Shereef Bishay</a>. In the video, he discusses how and why Dev Bootcamp was created, their mission and goals, and what the learning environment will be like during our time there.</p><br><br>

      <p>I found the lecture very intriguing, and it touched on quite a few topics that I have already discussed with family and friends. While technology and industry have grown at an unprecedented rate, our schooling has remained static and unchanged. The only thing that has really grown in terms of education is the tuition. In fact, many people who attend college simply go for the “experience”, which primarily includes social activities. Learning tends to take a backseat, and much of the time is spent “figuring out what you want to do.” In fact, four years out of college and I have more friends than not who are <b>still</b> trying to figure it out!</p><br><br>

      <p>This is where Dev Bootcamp comes in. The majority of people who attend DBC already know what they want to do: <b>program</b>. This is the bucket that I fall under. I eat, sleep, and breathe coding. And so far, I’ve noticed that most of my fellow classmates do too. Not only do we all have a passion for coding, but we are all <b>highly</b> motivated to take action and be the best developers that we can possibly be. There is absolutely something to be said to be surrounded with other people who are competitive, motivated, and know what they want – <b>they inspire you to be better</b>.</p><br><br>

      <p>DBC offers a unique and holistic approach to learning, focusing primarily on student needs not only as a developer, but also as a person. One of the most important points that Shereef discussed was the <b>chef vs. kitchen table</b> analogy. You can walk into the experience as a chef – ready to contribute, stand alongside your peers and mentors as an equal, and ready to cook up a new idea. Or, you can sit at the kitchen table, place your order, eat, and leave. Clearly the second option is much less interactive and engaging. If you simply sit at the table and place your order, you are missing out on such a vital part of the experience. It reminds me of this quote:</p><br><br>

      <i><p>”The best way to waste your life is by taking notes. The easiest way to avoid living is to just watch.”</i><br>
      - Chuck Palahniuk, Lullaby</p><br><br>

      <p>In addition to a positive learning environment, DBC encourages strong study habits (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Pomodoro Technique</a>) and mandatory yoga classes. I’ve never before seen a learning institution with such progressive practices. Honestly, this is the kind of thing that just makes me even more excited.</p><br><br>

      <p>The video has made me more aware of what is expected of me. It also showed what the mindset of the instructors will be in. I will admit, I do suffer from the <b>imposter syndrome</b>, (But it’s really me! I promise!) and I can foresee that happening when the in-person unit begins. However, knowing that we're all in the same boat and everyone else is probably feeling the same way does give me more confidence. I am so excited to be embarking on this journey and feel incredibly lucky to have the opportunity to do so!</p><br><br>
