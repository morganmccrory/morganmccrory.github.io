      <h1>A Short Note About Women in Tech</h1><h3>But, You’re A Girl</h3>

      <p>Ever since I announced to the world that I would be pursuing a career in software engineering, I have gotten this reaction far too many times: “But, you’re a girl.” Yes, thank you for your observation! I <b>am</b> a girl! I’m never really sure what this is supposed to mean when people say it though. Are you saying that I’m not as intelligent? Are you saying that it is going to be more difficult for me because it is such a male-dominated field? What exactly do you mean?</p><br><br>

      <p>Unfortunately, there is a shortage of women in the tech field, and in STEM careers in general. There was a great article posted on <a href="http://medium.com">Medium</a> a few months ago by Ann Friedman. It’s called <a href="https://medium.com/matter/this-is-the-last-thing-youll-ever-need-to-read-about-sexism-in-tech-56b9a3a77af0">Etsy’s Trying to Fix Tech’s Women Problem. Why Aren’t You?</a> Ann points out some very interesting statistics: The number of female computer grads has gone down from 37% in 1985 to 18% in 2012. Women make up 57% of the workforce, but only make up 25% of the tech industry. The one that I found the most startling was this: <b>women only make up 4% of start-ups</b>. Four percent!</p>

      <h3>The Arrington Theory</h3>

      <p>There is something called the <b>Arrington theory</b>, which suggests there are simply not enough women interested in this line of work. Perhaps this is true to some degree, I’m not really sure, but I think that part of this “disinterest” comes from sheer lack of exposure. For me, growing up, I was never encouraged to play with Legos or other “boy” toys. (Although I did rock out with Ninja Turtles!) I was given Barbies and American Girl dolls instead. Part of this has to do with my parents not being conscious of the messages they were sending, but those are also the toys that I wanted to play with because <b>that’s what all of my girl friends were playing with</b>. If they all like to play with Barbies, then shouldn’t I? It is hard for a seven-year-old to go against the grain. I think part of the problem is that we need to encourage girls to pursue these interests starting at a young age.</p><br>

      <p><a href="http://techcrunch.com">Tech Crunch</a> addressed another issue last year, in a much shorter article called <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/23/just-another-white-dude-writing-about-diversity/">Women in Tech: It’s Not Just A Pipeline Problem</a>. Many women who have pursued a career in tech, ultimately end up leaving. As the author, Jon Evans, points out:</p><br><br>

      <i><p>”Between ages 25 and 30, 41% of the young talent with credentials in those subject matters are female… <br><b>[but] 52% of this talent drops out</b>.</p></i>

      <h3>Where Are They Going?</h3>

      <p>So where are they going? Why are women leaving such a successful industry en masse? Maybe this can give us some ideas: <a href="http://fortune.com/2014/10/02/women-leave-tech-culture/">Why women leave tech: It’s the culture, not because ‘math is hard’</a>. It really does seem that there are some culture problems in the tech industry for women. “It was the lack of flexible working arrangements, the unsupportive work environment, or a salary that was inadequate to pay for childcare.”</p><br><br>

      <p>I’ll be honest: this trend does scare me. However, with all of this being said, I have felt the same pressures working in the finance industry for the past four years. Maybe I’m being naïve, but it sounds more like a <i>company</i> problem than an industry problem. I have to ask myself how many of these women left the field entirely instead of just leaving their current employer and starting somewhere with a better work-life balance? As these past four years have taught me: Not all companies were created equal.</p>

      <h3>Don’t Be a Brogrammer</h3>

      <p>Perhaps it will be harder for me, as a woman, in terms of fitting in culturally. However, the one thing I do know is that I will not be scared away. It is so rare to find something that you are <b>passionate</b> about and want to make a career out of. I hope to be part of a new generation of programmers who not only diversify the tech world, but thrive in it.</p><br><br>
