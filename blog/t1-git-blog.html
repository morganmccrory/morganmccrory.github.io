Hi everyone! This is my first official blog post on GitHub. I also have another blog on Tumblr, please check it out if you get a chance: <a href="http://codeshewrote.tumblr.com">Code She Wrote</a>. And, as always, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/morganmccrory">follow me</a> on Twitter!<br><br>
On to the actual challenge! Version control is a safe-guard against mistakes, and to keep track of your thought process while creating code. I will admit, I am guilty of making foolish mistakes in school on papers that I was supposed to write. I wouldnâ€™t realize that I had made a mistake, save the paper, and then open it up again later only to realize that I had deleted the entire third page. Oops! My English paper, however, was probably easier to re-write than an entire page of code would be. Using version control protects developers from making these types of mistakes.<br><br>
Git tracks changes by keeping track of all of your "commits." A commit is the your official commitment to making a change. It is a "snapshot" of your code that you can reference at any time. It saves a small change that you made so instead of sending in many updates at once, only a small update is sent. Git, and specifically GitHub, keep track of all of these so you can see the process that you went through to create the final version of a program.<br><br>
GitHub is extremely beneficial to store code. It allows other programmers to see your work and either comment or make changes themselves. You can also use GitHub to store group projects so that everyone can contribute to the project at the same time and all of the changes are merged together in one master file.<br><br>
Thank you for checking out my blog!
