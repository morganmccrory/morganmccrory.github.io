    <h1>Values: Are You Living Yours?</h1>

    <p>Everyone has certain values that they find meaningful and which are important to them. However, that doesn’t mean that we all have the same ones. A value that is super important to me might not even be on your list at all. When I think of the times that I have been the <b>happiest, proudest, and most satisfied</b>, I think of these values: (Next to each value is my ranking on a scale of 1 to 5 for how well I think I live up to them, with 5 being the highest.)</p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Accomplishment</b> (4)</li>
      <li>Accountability (4)</li>
      <li>Adventure (3)</li>
      <li><b>Ambition</b> (5)</li>
      <li>Challenge (4)</li>
      <li><b>Close relationships</b> (3)</li>
      <li>Coolness under fire (3)</li>
      <li>Excitement (4)</li>
      <li>Family (3)</li>
      <li>Friendships (3)</li>
      <li>Growth (4)</li>
      <li>Independence (4)</li>
      <li>Intellectual status (3)</li>
      <li>Movement (3)</li>
      <li>Persistence (3)</li>
      <li><b>Self-respect</b> (4)</li>
      <li>Sophistication (3)</li>
      <li><b>Stability</b> (4)</li>
      <li>Wealth (2)</li>
    </ul><br><br>

    <p>It is pretty weird for me to write out my values like this (and so publicly!) I think that my list is probably fairly common – especially things like friends and family. <b>Accomplishment</b> might be one of the less common items, but it is something that I do hold in high regard. If I don’t feel accomplished at the end of my day, then I am left unsatisfied. It makes me feel like I’m not doing as much as I could be doing with my day (or life.) And if I’m not living to my full potential – then what the heck am I doing?!</p><br><br>

    <p>I felt unfulfilled a lot at my previous job as an administrative assistant. I left every single day feeling as if I accomplished nothing that day. It was a terrible feeling. It took a huge toll on my self-worth, self-confidence, and the way that I viewed myself. I think that that experience is what made me hold accomplishments so high and shaped some of my other values as well.</p>

    <h3>Let Me Give You Some Advice</h3>

    <p>When someone approaches you with a big problem that they are upset about, the best response that I have ever heard was: <b>“Would you like me to only listen, or would you like me to give you some advice?”</b> I am 100% guilty of offering unsolicited advice to my friends, whether they want to hear it or not. In my early twenties, I thought that this was just me being “blunt” or “telling it like it is” but as I have gotten older, I’ve realized that it kind of just made me sound like a <b>know-it-all</b>. Now, that’s not to say that I don’t know anything, only that I don’t know <i>everything</i>. Now that I am older (and wiser), I’ve been making a big effort to only give advice when it is asked of me</p><br><br>

    <p>The last time one of my friends did ask for my advice was when she was debating if she should stay in grad school to do what she loved, or if she should quit and get a higher-paying job doing something that didn’t make her as happy. I was actually a full-time graduate student myself (while also working full-time) not too long ago, so she said she knew I had experience in a similar situation. In my case, I ended up dropping out of grad school because I wasn’t passionate about the field, and I was also driving myself crazy doing both school and work full-time. It wasn’t worth it! <b>But my experiences weren’t the same as her experiences.</b></p><br><br>

    <p>We ended up having more of a dialogue about what she was going through as opposed to just me giving her advice – which I think was exactly what she needed. I told her that at the end of the day, whatever job she chose to do would be the job that she would have for the rest of her life, so it should probably be something that she loved. Money may make a lot of problems go away, but it won’t fulfill you. She decided to stay in grad school and is currently pursuing her dream job. Value-wise, this fits into friendship and close relationships. I have found that <b>I am a better friend when I wait for someone to request advice</b> rather than forcing them to listen to my opinion whether they want to or not.</p>

    <h3>Values and Stereotype Threat</h3>

    <p>When I think about my values, I feel proud of myself. I feel happy, secure, and self-confident. It should go without saying, but if you find yourself feel down or insecure, maybe check and see if you aren’t contributing to any of your values? This can help mediate stereotype threat if you recognize what you are feeling.>/p><br><br>

    <p>I talked last week about stereotype threat, how to recognize its signs, and how to combat it if you felt like it was happening. One of the biggest ways to stop it is to encourage self-affirmation.  People who have high levels of self-confidence are less likely to get bogged down when they encounter someone who stereotypes. This concept goes hand-in-hand with knowing your values. Know your values and try to live by them every day, and this will encourage self-affirmation. It’s not something that you decide to do one time and then magically you live your life differently. It is a <b>decision</b> that you have to make <i>every</i> single day. It is also something that you will have to remember even when you are feeling uncomfortable or anxious. <b>It’s not easy</b>. But it’s worth it.</p><br><br>

    <p>Personally, I will use the exercise of remembering my values when I am feeling down at DBC, and also in my personal life. It is something I am still working on and need to remind myself of when I get frustrated with a situation. But living your values works best when you incorporate it with other exercises that may help when feeling down threatened. One, get some actual exercise! Go for a brisk walk or job for 15-30 minutes every day. Do an activity that gets your heartbeat up and your blood flowing. Two, make sure that you are eating well with good nutrition. This might require better meal prep or even vitamin supplements. Three, look on the bright side. <b>A positive attitude goes a long way!</b> You may be surprised.</p><br><br>

    <p>I hope you guys remember your values and try to live by them every day. Even if it’s still a work-in-progress!</p><br><br>
