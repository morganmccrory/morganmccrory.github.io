  <h1>Graduation</h1>
  <center><img src="../imgs/dbc2.jpg"></center><br><br>

  <p>We did it! The 2015 Sea Lions have officially graduated! It is crazy to think about how quickly the program went by. It was simultaneously the longest and shortest 2.5 months of my life. The days were long, stretching from 10 to 14 hours, but then the weeks themselves went by in a flash. It was a wierd feeling waking up this morning and having nowhere that I had to be. I settled on watching Pretty Little Liars while I work on updating my GitHub portfolio. I can't say I'm complaining!</p><br><br>

  <p><a href="http://houserulz.herokuapp.com" >Also, House Rules is up and running!</a> It was an intense project, and I learned <b> a lot</b> from the process. We worked for about 4 days trying to build the app using React and Flux. Both the language and the architecture were new to us - alas, this might not have been the wisest idea. We realized that he had gone down a rabbit hole on Tuesday (the final product was due on Friday), so we switched gears and re-wrote everything using what we knew: Ruby, Rails, JQuery, and AJAX. It is hard for me to walk away from this project still feeling as though it is incomplete. I still want to incorporate the SplitWise API for "Billing", I want to change the format of the calendar for "Events" (by using the fullcalendar gem in Ruby), and I want to polish off so many things that were left as MVP. Unfortunately, my To Do list is ever-growing, but I am hoping maybe this weekend I will get to make the app I had originally envisioned.</p><br><br>

  <p>What else is on my To Do list? Learning Python is one of my top priorities. Expect some upcoming blog posts on the similarities and differences between Ruby and Python! I also want to explore Redis and Elasticsearch. Even though DBC is over, I feel like my education is just beginning. There is still so much to do, so much to learn!</p><br><br>

  <p>I am so thankful that I heard about this program and took a chance to complete it. I met amazing people and learned so much not only technically, but also about myself. I couldn't be happier with my experience there and I look forward to contributing back to DBC as soon as I can - whether as a Phase 0 guide or a mentor.</p><br><br>
