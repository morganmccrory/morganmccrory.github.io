    <h1>Thinking Style</h1>

      I definitely have been guilty of having a fixed mindset for a long time. I have thought previously that intelligence is static and does not change: either you are intelligent or not, there is no changing! (Well that is a bummer, right?) I wouldn't necessarily avoid challenges, but I would give up easily or be discourages very quickly when working at something. I would put in a lot of effort, but as soon as there was a bump in the road, I would get stressed out, throw my hands up, and feel as though all of my work was worthless. I felt threatened by others being successful, and hearing of their success always made me feel a little bit worse about what was going on in my life.<br><br>
      However, since learning about the different thinking styles, I have made a proactive effort to change my mindset into more of a growth mindset. Intelligence can be developed and changed over time (which is a good thing!) A growth mindset embraces challenges and persists in the face of setbacks. Effort is the path to mastery. There is a great quote that I love: "Failing a bunch of times is the first step to getting really good at something." Because no one is born a great programmer, or painter, or football player, or any other profession that requires a high level of skill. It is all about working and improving yourself and powering through. I have been trying to do that in my 3 weeks at DBC and I like to think that I have been fairly successful!<br><br>
      My experience at DBC has had it's ups and downs in just the past 3 short weeks. I have felt really confident - such as when working with HTML and CSS, which I had a little bit if prior experience with. This week, however, I felt totally lost. I had already read "Learn to Program" by Chris Pine and completed the 7 hour Codecademy course, so I thought this week would be a breeze. However, I didn't realize how much I had actually forgotten since I went through both of those materials, and I was left feeling extremely incompetent! I am powering through, however, and keeping the growth mindset. I am looking forward to this week and really starting to hone my skills and be the best programmer that I can be. Here we go!
