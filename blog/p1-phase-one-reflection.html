  <h1>Thoughts on Phase One</h1>

  <p>I'm almost done with Phase 1 of DBC!! We have our assessments tomorrow morning to determine if each of us will proceed to Phase 2 or have to repeat Phase 1 again. I studied a little bit, going over algorithms and creating single responsibility classes, but I honestly feel like I have a good handle on the material. There’s not much else I can do between tonight and tomorrow morning! Our assessments were actually supposed to be <i>this</i> morning, but the internet has been out at DBC since yesterday.</p><br><br>

  <p>The Squirrels, who are currently in Phase 3, will graduate tomorrow afternoon and I’m so excited for them! They’ve been slaving for the past 10 days on their final projects, and I’m excited to see how they turned out. It’s a little bit a bummer, but we won’t actually get to see their presentations live since we will be taking our exams during that time. Oh well! Unfortunately even a bootcamp of 30+ software developers can’t stop the internet from breaking down when it wants to.</p><br><br>

  <p>I’m really enjoying doing DBC full-time now, it’s such a change from Phase 0. As my one fellow student proclaimed, it’s a bit surreal coding all the time now. I know that, for me, I’ve been happier and more upbeat lately since I’m no longer working a job that I don’t enjoy. I’m doing something that I actually enjoy with my time now and it feels great!</p><br><br>

  <p>We’ve covered a lot of material in the past three weeks. A short list: algorithms, design principles (aka. making easily- changeable code), debugging, recursion, single responsibility, parsing data, scraping websites, Nokogiri, Pry, SQL, Active Record, RSpec, and ARGV basics just to name a few. We’ve also done a lot of review from Phase 0, which has been nice and been a good refresher at just how far we’ve already come.</p><br><br>

  <p>The biggest change has been all of the peer-pairing. We are pairing for 8 hours a day, 3 days a week! That’s a lot of pairing! Some pairs have gone better than others, but I feel like I am gaining a better understanding of how I work with other people and how I can improve. Technical abilities come a bit easier to me, but being an effective pair is a little bit harder.</p><br><br>

  <p>I am going to update more next week so I’m not throwing five topics all into one post, but I wanted to update everyone on my progress so far! Cross your fingers that I progress to Phase 2 tomorrow, and hope everyone has a great weekend!</p><br><br>
