  <h1>Conflict Dynamics</h1>

  <p>When conflicts remain unsolved, they can escalate quickly. <a href="http://youtu.be/5SnSzo4AbRI">Check out this clip from "The Office"</a>, which addresses this situation quite well.</p><br><br>

  <p>Fairly recently, I’ve been having a lot of trouble getting along with one of my roommates. It’s interesting, because I have tons of experience living with different types of people and different dynamics. But for some reason, this particular roommate and I have been having trouble seeing eye-to-eye. It’s not that either one of us are bad people, or even bad roommates at that, it’s just that our personalities seem to have trouble meshing together without extra effort from both of us.</p><br><br>

  <p>There was no “big event” that happened that created tension, but rather a series of really small encounters that piled on top of each other until finally becoming too big to bear. After hanging out for a couple hours in the living room, she would leave the room without saying “good night” or even anything at all . “Hmm, well that’s weird, but no big deal,” I thought. Other times, I would text her and get no response back. “Yep, definitely weird. But still not a huge deal,” I thought again. It was finally when (it seemed) that she did not invite me out with our third roommate that I finally had enough. My conclusion was that she simply didn’t like me, for a reason unbeknown. I was upset because even if you don’t like someone, but are in a mutual environment such as work or home, then that is still no reason to be rude. I wasn’t sure how to handle the situation, so I shut down and avoided seeing her as much as I could.</p><br><br>

  <p><center><i>“Conflict can and should be handled constructively; when it is, relationships benefit.<br>
  Conflict avoidance is *not* the hallmark of a good relationship. On the contrary,<br>
  it is a symptom of serious problems and of poor communication.”</i><br>
  - Harriet B. Braiker, <u>Who’s Pulling Your Strings?</u></center></p><br><br><br>

  <p>Shortly after I started spending more time alone in my room, my roommate and I ended up talking things out. She said that from her point of view, it seemed that <b>I</b> didn’t like <b>her</b>. “But that’s ridiculous!” I said. “What have I done to give you that impression?” She then went on to explain that the reason she hadn’t texted me back was because she was a little upset from the night before because it was her birthday and I didn’t celebrate with her. Without going into crazy detail, while I didn’t agree with her, I did try to understand where she was coming from. Each specific incident held a similar explanation, and we both felt a bit embarrassed that the whole thing blew up into as big of a deal as it did.</p>

  <h3>Conflict Resolution: It’s a Skill</h3>

  <p>In my conflict with my roommate, I would go back and handle it differently if I could. Instead of brushing each little situation under the rug, I would have addressed them immediately as they happened. In fact, this is the agreement that we reached when we did finally talk about what was going on. Even though the situation may seem small and insignificant at the time, they pile on each other until they become mountains. The trick is to stop it from ever reaching this level, by giving the conflict no foundation. More often than not, <b>open, honest communication is the key</b>. Sometimes you will reach mutual understanding, but that may not happen every single time. The problem in this situation is that <i>neither</i> of us were communicating at all with each other.</p><br><br>

  <p><b>Building the skills and confidence to appropriately handle a conflict begins with <i>you</i>.</b> Unfortunately, you can’t change other people, not can you change the circumstances in which a conflict occurs. However, the thing you do have control over is <b>you</b>. You can control your response and reaction to the conflict, and therefore change the conflict dynamics of the interaction.</p>

  <h3>When Your Buttons Get Pushed, Turn Them OFF</h3>

  <p>I read a great article on Huffington Post the other day called <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/christine-hassler/self-help_b_2476642.html">What to Do When Someone Pushes Your Buttons</a>.  The important takeaway is to <b>take responsibility</b> for your feelings. The other person did not make you feel this way, but rather your feel this way as your <i>reaction</i> to them, and that is something you have control over. Once you break down the feelings that you’re experiencing, you can regain that control. Christine recommends taking some time for yourself and figuring out the bottom line as to why you are upset. Do you feel rejected? Misunderstood? Not good enough? Ask yourself what has triggered this response, and what this situation means. Does it mean that the person doesn’t respect you? Relations are too much work. You never get what you want? Etc. Take responsibility for your role in the conflict, and then <b>authentically communicate with the person who triggered the upset</b>. How can this be worked out?</p><br><br>

  <p>Although I have been primarily talking about personal relationships in this blog post, they directly apply to work relationships. Steve Jobs has talked about teamwork and collaboration in some of his speeches. How a leader responds to a disagreement makes a difference in the quality of decisions that result. <a href="http://youtu.be/f60dheI4ARg">Check out Steve Jobs on “wonderful arguments” here</a>.</p><br><br>
