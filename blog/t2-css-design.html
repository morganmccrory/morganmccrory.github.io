      Today I am going to talk about the CSS design elements of Margins, Borders, and Padding. Most web pages are made up of boxes that contain each of these elements. For example, the white space around this blog post is a box placed on top of the grey diagonal line background image. I positioned this white box by using all 3 design elements.<br><br>
      The Margin is the outermost element from your actual box. If I type in 'margin-left: 15px' then the beginning of my white box will start 15 pixels away from the left side of my screen. I can do this on all 4 sides of the box. But you don't have to use pixels! You can also adjust margins using percentages or other units of measurement depending on your preferences. It is very similar to determining margings in a Word document. In Word, a margin is the white space between the edge of the page and your content. It is the same with CSS.<br><br>
      The Border is also exactly what it sounds like - the edge of your box. You can choose to have a border or not have one, depending on what you want to do with your webpage. You can also make the border as big or little as you would like. The input for this border on this page is: 'border: 2px solid #d3d3d3;' Can you guess what each part means? The border is 2 pixels wide, solid, and #d3d3d3 is the color code. You can use either the names of a color, or the color code if you would like to be more specific. You can have a dashed or solid border as well. Can you guess what kind of border I used around the navigation menu at the top of the page?<br><br>
      Finally, we have the Padding element. The padding is the space between the border and any other content that you want to include in your box. As you have probably figured out, I used Padding on this webpage to put some space in between the border and the text that you are reading right now! You can adjust the size of all 4 sides individually to customize the padding any way that you want to.<br><br>
      I hope you learned a little in this introduction to CSS Design elements. Please send me any email if you have any questions!
