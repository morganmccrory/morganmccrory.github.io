      Arrays and hashes are good to use in Ruby. Arrays are essentially justs lists on your computer. Each slot acts like a variable and they are assigned my numbers. What is interesting is that instead of begining with "1", the first object in an array is actually "0". This will take some getting used to! However, arrays are useful for a lot of things - one of which could be a list of names. Instead of typing "Names1 = Morgan Names 2 = Tyler" you can do it all in one list: "Names = [Morgan, Tyler]". This makes Arrays an extremely useful tool to use in Ruby!<br><br>
      Hashes are very similar to Arrays, except for the fact that instead of using numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, etc.) as keys, you can actually create the keys yourself. An example of the syntax for a hash would be: hash { first_name => Morgan, last_name => McCrory}. And then I can call the specific value paired with the key by simply typing: "hash[first_name]". Pretty cool, right? <br><br>
      What is also interesting about arrays and hashes is that there are special methods that you can call on both of them. One of my favorites to call on an array is .each. This creates a key that is the same for all of the objects stored within the array, and then performs the action on each one of them. This is very useful for a lot of programs, as you can probably tell!<br><br>
      I hope to update this more tomorrow but thank you for checking out my blog! Hope you have a great day!
