      <h1>My Personal Thinking Style</h1>

      <p>Ground-breaking observation: all people are not the same! Everyone thinks and learns in their own unique way. The way that I learn best might not be the way that you learn best. <b>Professor Anthony Gregorc</b>, who teaches at the University of Connecticut, has divided learning/working styles into these four groups:<br><br>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Concrete Sequential</b> - Tend to focus on how things actually exist. They are based in reality, and process information in an ordered, linear way.</li>

        <li><b>Concrete Random</b> - Use their intuition and like to take risks. They experiment to find answers.</li>

        <li><b>Abstract Random</b> - Are “people-persons” and organize information through reflection. </li>

        <li><b>Abstract Sequential</b> - Analyze situations before acting and apply logic when solving problems.</li>
      </ul></p><br><br>

      <p>No thinking style is superior: they are just different. You can read more about them <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">here</a>. It is stressed that you simply become aware of what your thinking style is, and use that knowledge to understand yourself better. If you know the way that your own mind operates, then you can making learning more effective and better relate to others.

      <h3>So What’s Yours?</h3>

      <p>The results of my own quiz-taking experience was an exact tie between <b>Concrete Sequential</b> and <b>Abstract Sequential</b>. (At least they are both sequential, right? A tie between Concrete Sequential and Abstract Random might have been a little more confusing!) About 12 points behind was Abstract Random, and then in last place was Concrete Random.</p><br><br>

      <p>What does this mean? Well, it means that I am a combination of being realistic, analyzing situations, and being logical. It makes sense to me, because I feel like the two go hand in hand. It means that I like order, getting facts, logical sequences, having my voice heard, analyzing before acting, and applying logic to find a solution. I learn best when I have a structured environment, can apply ideas in pragmatic ways, have access to references, and am able to work alone. What is hard for me? Discussions with no specific point, unorganized environments, unclear instructions, abstract questions, not monopolizing conversations, and repetitive tasks.</p>

      <h3>Growth vs. Fixed Mindset</h3>

      <p>What is a <b>fixed mindset</b>? It is something that I have previously been guilty of, and am making an active effort to overcome. If someone has a fixed mindset, they believe that intelligence is static and does not change: either you are intelligent or not, there is no changing! (Well that is a bummer, right?) For me, I wouldn't necessarily avoid challenges, but I would give up easily or be discouraged very quickly when trying to do something. I would put in a lot of effort, but as soon as there was a bump in the road, I would get stressed out, throw my hands up, and feel as though all of my work was worthless. As a result, people with a fixed mindset plateau early and never really achieve their full potential. This is not an ideal mindset to have, and it can be detrimental to someone’s personal and professional life.</p><br><br>

      <p>There is also a <b>growth</b> mindset. They believe that intelligence can be developed and changed over time. The growth mindset embraces challenges and persists in the face of setbacks. <b>Effort is the path to mastery</b>. There is a great quote that I love: "Failing a bunch of times is the first step toward getting really good at something." Because no one is born a great programmer, or painter, or football player, or any other profession that requires a high level of skill. It is all about working hard and continuously improving yourself. As a result, people of the growth mindset have a greater sense of free will, and often achieve their full potential.</p>

      <h3>All About Perspective</h3>

      <p><b>Awareness is key!</b> Being conscious of a habit or behavior is the first step toward changing that behavior. When I first started DBC, I was unaware that these two mindsets existed (and Psychology was my second major in college!) Since learning about them, and admitting that I was prone to the fixed mindset, I have made a proactive effort to change. I have found much success in simply making the conscious decision to react in a different way than I was used to. If a small setback comes along, I think that there are two ways that I can deal with it. I can get upset, think negatively, and make the situation worse than it actually is. Or, I can stay positive and make the best out of the situation.</p><br><br>

      <p>I had a tough time trying to upgrade my computer’s operating system from Snow Leopard to Yosemite, which resulted in a 10+ hour ordeal at the Apple store. Fighting the impulse to get frustrated, I stayed positive and embraced this as a new learning experience. Once everything was resolved, I realized that I had so many improvements made to my computer that it was almost like it was brand new again! Score! It’s all about perspective.</p><br><br>
