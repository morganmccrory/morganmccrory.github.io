      <h1><a href="http://morganmccrory.github.com/blog/p2-final-projects.html">The Beginning of The End</a></h1>

  <p>We started final projects today! Lots of user stories, schemas, and wireframing. Before the end of the day, we're looking to have our models and migrations done, and possibly our controller - but that may be optimistic. It took us a while to come to full agreement on all aspects of our app, but now that we have I think the process will be much smoother than it would have been otherwise. What's that - what app are we building, you ask? Why, let me tell you!</p>

  <center><h3>House Rules</h3></center>

  <p>Our app is going to facilitate how you interact with your roommates. We brainstormed a lot of problems that we have faced in our own lives when living with roommates and tried to think of how an app could solve most of these problems. It's always awkward to text someone to remind them that they owe you money. It would also be nice to be able to see all of the bills associated with the apartment in one convenient place. In my apartment right now, we have an "Inventory List" of communal household items including toilet paper, paper towels, dishwasher detergent, etc. - our app can keep track of who's turn it is to buy a specific item. Our list ended up being fairly long, so many ideas were iceboxed, but our final app should include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Create an account and log in</li>
    <li>See lease and landlord contact information</li>
    <li>Post text and pictures to the "fridge" (ie. like a main Slack channel between roommates)</li>
    <li>Log of how much I owe my roommates and for what</li>
    <li>Customize how rent is split among roommates</li>
    <li>View all bills associated with the house and see if the current bill has been paid</li>
    <li>Automatic reminder sent if a roommate owes someone money and they haven't paid in 5 days</li>
    <li>CRUD house rules, including approval between all roommates</li>
    <li>CRUD inventory, and see what items are in-stock, low-stock, and out-of-stock</li>
    <li>CRUD house chores, and send reminder to a roommate if they haven't completed a certain chore in a while</li>
  </ul>
<br><br>
  <p>As far as technologies, we are using a PostgreSQL database, Ruby for back-end, and React.js for front-end. We'll also be utilizing the Splitwise and Boxcar APIs. This isn't a final list by any means, but this is where we are at as of right now. I can't believe we will have our final project completed in only 7 days! Wish us luck!</p><br>
