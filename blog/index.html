  <p>Learning how to ask a good question is an important skill that many of us don't think about. If you've ever posted a question on a forum and not gotten a response, there is a possibility that the question was worded poorly or didn't include enough information. Today I am going to go over how to ask a good question, especially in the tech community, to optimize the quality of the responses that you will get in return. Let's get started!</p>

  <h3>Before you ask</h3>

  <p>Before you post your question online, make sure that you have exhausted all of the other resources available to you. Chances are that someone else has encountered a similar problem and has already asked the same thing. A really great resource to search for common programming questions is <a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a>. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of questions posted on this site. <b>I recommend starting here!</b> In addition, there are plenty of other great resources out there. Or, you can always just <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> it.</p>

  <h3>Pretend you're talking to a busy colleague</h3>

  <p>If you exhaust all of your options from searching online and still can't find the answer you are looking for, then you'll have to ask the question yourself. The best piece of advice that I've heard is to pretend that you're talking to a busy colleague and sum up your question in one sentence. What details will that person need to know in order to give you the best answer possible? <b>Be concise, but descriptive</b>. Be sure to include any error messages, key APIs, or other unusual differences that make your question unique. Also, <b>make sure your spelling and grammar are correct</b>. This is very important for readability and will make yur question easier to understand.</p><br><br>

  <p><b>Bad Examples:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Confused about JavaScript</li>
      <li>What is going on with my computer?</li>
      <li>Funny error message, not sure what is wrong.</li>
    </ul></p>
  <br><br><br>
  <p><b>Good Examples:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>In Ruby, why does str == "texting" evaluate to false when str is set to "texting"?</li>
      <li>In Ruby, why does using a float instead of an integer give me different results even though all of my inputs are integers?</li>
      <li>How can I make something happen when two divs touch each other in JavaScript?</li>
    </ul></p>
  <br>

  <h3>That's a good question!</h3>

  <p>Most of the questions that go unanswered in Stack Overflow and other forums, are not asked in a clear way as described above. It isn't hard to ask a good question, but it does take some practice. <b>It may help to post a sample of the code that is giving you problems after you have asked your question</b>. This will give other people a chance to look for other errors in the code that may be causing this problem that you yourself didn't realize. Also, never be afraid to ask for clarification if you don't understand something or if you are confused by the explanation given.</p><br><br>
