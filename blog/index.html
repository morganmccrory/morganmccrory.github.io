      <h1><a href="http://morganmccrory.github.com/blog/c5-feedback.html">Peer Pairing and Giving Feedback</a></h1>
      <p><b>Pair programming</b> is a popular technique used by organizations to enable developers to learn quickly and make fewer errors. At boot camp, the preferred method is <b>Driver-Navigator</b> - this is when one person writes the actual code (or “drives”) and the other person navigates by walking them through the process. Pair programming is a great procedure to use! With two people looking at the same code at the same time, fewer mistakes are made and the code comes out looking a lot cleaner. You can <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/17/pair-programming-considered-extremely-beneficial/">read more about pair programming here</a>. However, it does require <b>open, friendly communication</b> and <b>mutual respect</b>. If one person thinks that they are right 100% of the time, then using this technique would be ineffective. In fact, pair programming can be a skill in its own right.</p>

      <h3>Pairing: Just Like Peanut Butter and Jelly</h3>

      <p>I’ve found that you can usually tell within the first five minutes of writing code with someone whether you are going to work well together or not. Ideally, you should <b>complement</b> your pair, and they should complement you. I have different strengths and weaknesses than you do. If one of my strengths is one of your weaknesses and vice versa, then we would probably make a great team. This, in addition to open communication and respect, make the ideal pair programming session.</p><br><br>

      <p>A positive pairing session usually happens organically, as the two of you find your own rhythm and flow. Your brains end up syncing at some point, and ideas flow quickly and freely between the two of you. Of the twelve pairing sessions that I have had so far, I’ve had this happen only two or three times. <b>However, the times that it has happened were some of the most beneficial moments of the boot camp.</b> It was in one of my first pairing sessions that I learned the “Tab” shortcut in the Terminal to automatically finish inputting the directory or file name. More recently, this past week, my partner and I got into such a nice groove that we wrote one of the most elegant codes that I have written thus far. It might have only been 25 lines long, but it was beautiful! </p><br><br>

      <p>Of course, there have also been some frustrating moments while pair programming. One of the more difficult things, for me, is to be patient with my peers who may not be practicing on their own quite as much as I am. I get a little frustrated when someone doesn’t know certain principles, which I may think are very basic, but are harder for them to grasp than it was for me. It is also frustrating when we are not <b>time-boxing</b> correctly and don’t switch driver-navigator roles halfway through. I have had some pairs who drove the entire session, and I realize that part of it is on me because I didn’t speak up about it. <b>Even though some sessions don’t go as well as they could, it is still great practice to work with different types of people and build different professional relationships.</b></p>

      <h3>Feedback: Actionable, Specific, and Kind</h3>

      <p>At Dev Bootcamp, we are required to submit anonymous feedback to every person that we pair with. The feedback must be <b>actionable</b>, <b>specific</b>, and <b>kind</b>. This is harder than it sounds! Being kind comes naturally for me, but actionable and specific are more difficult beasts. Things will go “ok” or be “fine” in general, and it is harder for me to pinpoint specific things that happened that I can comment on. Or, even more often, there is simply no actionable criticism to give other than “Good job, keep up the great work!” Giving constructive feedback takes practice and a certain understanding of the person who you are giving feedback to. I think that as I get to know my peers better, I will be able to give more specific feedback that they can use to become better developers.</p><br><br>

      <p>The feedback that I have received so far has been mostly <b>positive</b>. I can tell that others have my own same issues, and so I tend to get notes saying “Good job, keep up the great work!” about as often as I send them out. Sometimes, however, I will get constructive criticism and usually they say things that I am already aware of that I need to work on. Yet, it does <b>motivate</b> me to work even harder on them, especially knowing that others can spot my flaws as we work together . <i>(I don’t want to have weaknesses! I want to be Superwoman! ;-) )</i> Based on my feedback, I am going to try to speak up more when it is my time to take on the Driver role, and further familiarize myself with what type of objects certain Ruby methods work on. The best fix is to continue practicing, and putting my best foot forward!</p><br><br>
