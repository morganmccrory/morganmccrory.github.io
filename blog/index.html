      <h1><a href="http://morganmccrory.github.com/blog/c6-stereotype-threat.html">Let’s Talk About Stereotype Threat</a></h1>
      <p><a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/definition.html">What is Stereotype Threat?</a> In simple terms, it refers to the risk of conforming to a negative stereotype about one’s group. The term was first used by <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/bibliography_steele_aronson.html"> Steele and Aronson (1995)</a> when they conducted multiple experiments which showed that when race was emphasized, black college students performed worse on standardized tests than white students. However, when race was <b>not</b> emphasized, black students performed both equivocal and better than white students. These studies showed that performance may be hindered by awareness of one’s racial stereotypes.</p>

      <h3>What are the consequences?</h3>

      <p>There is more than just underperformance on academic tests at stake with stereotype threat. In a way, it can end up being a <b>self-fulfilling prophecy</b>. If you think that a negative outcome is going to happen, you unconsciously behave in a certain way that encourages that thing to happen. This is exactly the same self-handicapping strategy that results from stereotype threat. For example, if you think that you are not smart, then you may spend less time studying for an exam. When it comes time to take the exam you end up failing. Now, let’s think about it. Did you fail the exam because you are <b>actually</b> not smart? No, you failed because you didn’t study enough. This can happen with anything from academics, to an artistic skill, to sports. It is a true psychological phenomenon, but the important part is that <b>it can be avoided</b>.</p><br><br>

      <p>Furthermore, studies have shown that consistent exposure to stereotype threat can make people <b>want</b> to succeed less in a certain domain. If you are constantly seeing people who are different from you succeed in a certain profession, and you are not able to relate to them, it can be easy to want to throw in the towel for that profession altogether. Take a look at this comic:</p><br>

      <p>All it takes is <b>one</b> person to say a negative stereotype such as this one, and you start to doubt yourself. “Maybe I’m <i>not</i> good at math. I am the only girl in my class… maybe there is a reason? You know what, math is stupid. I don’t even like it.” This seem like an extreme example, but imagine if this inner conversation took place over several months or years. It doesn’t seem so irrational anymore. If a girl really does believe that girls are not at math, that is going to severely limit the professions that she considers to pursue. This helps to illustrate how stereotype threat may contribute to educational and social inequality.</p>

      <h3>Who is vulnerable?</h3>

      <p>In short: <b>everyone</b>.  It does not matter what race, gender, etc. that you are – you can still suffer from stereotype threat in a situation that includes a stereotype-based expectation of poor performance. The fact is that stereotypes exist everywhere, for <b>every</b> group, and so anyone can fall victim. Although, interestingly enough, research has showed that some members of a particular group may be more susceptible than others. The biggest factor is how strongly one identifies with a certain group. A person may physically be part of one group, but if they do not associate themselves with that particular group, then they will have an easier time avoiding stereotype threat. It is important to be aware that not only can it happen to you, but it can also happen to the people around you. Even if you think they aren’t susceptible, they are.</p>

      <h3>Girls don’t suck at math</h3>

      <p>We’ve all been talked down to, or made to feel like we need to “prove” ourselves – a concept I have touched upon in previous blog posts. My own experience with stereotype threat have to do with being a girl in a male-dominated field. Math has always been one of my favorite subjects in school (with English as a close second), so I have never doubted my abilities. However, I have had to have a strong spine and let certain comments roll off my shoulders.</p><br><br>

      <p>My worst experience actually happened earlier this week. I had a peer pairing session with another student, and he was just not a nice person. Any input that I tried to give was met with responses such as, <b>“How would you know?”</b> Well… I certainly don’t know any less than you, so how would I not know? I got really angry and insulted, and ended up just stopping to contribute. I stopped talking because I felt like I wasn’t being valued or respected. Who wants to work with someone like that? No one! I wasn’t sure if he was behaving that way because I am a girl, or if he just had a bad day, or maybe that is just how he is all the time and he is a very unaware of himself.</p><br><br>

      <p>So, he made some condescending comments and I stopped contributing to the project. While I do brush things off most of the time (and I did in this scenario, too, it just took me a little longer), this experience gave me doubts for a hot second. Maybe I’m not good at programming? If I am intelligent and an asset to the team I am working with, then why am I being treated this way? Is this what I will have to deal with when I am working in this field? No one has 100% self-confidence all of the time. Even though I briefly doubted myself, I also knew: No, this guy just seems like a jerk, and I will make sure not to work with him again in the future. What worries me is what if he is this same way with someone who has less self-confidence than I have. What if someone says these things to another person who can’t just brush them off?</p>

      <h3>How can we help?</h3>

      <p>The fact is that as long as stereotypes themselves exist, so will stereotype threat. So if we can’t eradicate it completely, what can we do to minimize the effects? First, and perhaps most obvious, is to simply be aware of our own stereotypes about ourselves and about different groups.</p><br>

      <p>Sometimes we might not even realize that we’re using stereotypes. Try <b>reframing</b> or use different syntax to describe the task at hand. This might mean being more politically correct, or describing something in a way that does not invoke stereotypes. Even simply addressing the situation might help decrease stereotype threat, because suddenly it isn’t a taboo topic and it can be openly talked about.</p><br><br>

      <p><b>Encouraging self-affirmation</b> is another positive way that we can fight stereotype threat. If people have high levels of self-confidence, then they are less likely to get bogged down when they encounter someone who stereotypes. This can be done by encouraging others to that their skills and values are important. Self-affirmations have been shown to alleviate some of the psychological threat that comes from fears of supporting a stereotype. In fact, it’s something that we should all be telling ourselves, regardless of the situation. </p><br><br>

      <p>Finally, we can emphasize the growth mindset. <a href="http://morganmccrory.github.io/blog/c2-thinking-styles.html">In a previous blog post</a>, I discussed the differences between a growth and a fixed mindset. A fixed mindset believes that intelligence is static and never changes. You are either good at something, or you’re not. A growth mindset believes that intelligence can be changed and developed over time. You must embrace challenges and work hard to continuously improve yourself. By <b>embracing the growth mindset</b>, we are encourages others to be the best version of themselves.  This mindset can reduce or even eliminate a threat against someone’s ability. It encourages people to “let things roll of their shoulders,” so to speak. They react more effectively to challenges and are less likely to create self-fulfilling prophecies.</p><br><br>
